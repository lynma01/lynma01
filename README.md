## Background:
Self-taught and project-driven, started with Mozilla's Web Dev course before realizing my passion for all things data-infrastructure.

### ðŸ“š:
1. [The Utopia of Rules: On Technology, Stupidity, and the Secret Joys of Bureaucracy](https://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-Technology-Stupidity-Bureaucracy/dp/1612195180)
    - In the same vein as, [No Mercy, No Malice](https://www.profgalloway.com/), breaches of B2G financial compliance rules usually aren't premeditated or malicious, rather, it's businesses following the path-of-least-resistance for sharing data. It's really funny, and got me thinking a lot about public-sector tech.

2. [Net Assessment and Military Strategy: Retrospective and Prospective Essays](https://www.amazon.com/Assessment-Military-Strategy-Retrospective-Communications/dp/1621965392)
    - It's one thing to do operations research machine-learning, it's another thing entirely to turn those analyses into a business strategy. From the most scientifically rigorous strategist I know of, [Andrew Marshall](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XKVQJK7/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). If I had to craft strategy/policy, I'd use his book as a blueprint. 

3. [The Geography of Risk: Epic Storms, Rising Seas, and the Cost of America's Coasts](https://www.amazon.com/Geography-Risk-Storms-Rising-Americas/dp/0374160805)
    -  A book about systems and the political/climatic environments undermining them. I believe data-engineers will play the key role in solving these issues. The book aligned with many federal process audits hammering: [opaque reporting requirements for disaster survivors](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-503), [the responder-workforce's skills mismatch](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-360), [inaccurate hazard maps](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-22-104079), [and the national flood-insurance program's financial insolvency](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-508).
